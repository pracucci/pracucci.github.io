### Chrome HTTPS icon changes

Starting from Chrome 46, Chrome will stop displaying the lock icon on HTTPS pages with mixed content, while will use the same neutral page icon as HTTP pages.

### Chrome DevTools Security Tab

Chrome 48 (Canary) introduces a new Security tab in the DevTools, that aims to help you debug HTTPS issues. It's yet another improvement to DevTools, that will hopefully help developers to investigate some weird HTTPS certificate issues that sometimes occur.
