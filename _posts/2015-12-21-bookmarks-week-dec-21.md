### Bookmarks

- [Introducing Background Sync in Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync): an API to schedule any data sending that you care about beyond the life cycle of the page.
- [Why Facebook chose to move to HTML5 video](https://code.facebook.com/posts/159906447698921). Facebook recently switched from a Flash-based to HTML5 video player for all Facebook web videos. In this article they explain why they did it and the challenges they had to overcome.
- [An update on SHA-1 certificates in Chrome](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.it/2015/12/an-update-on-sha-1-certificates-in.html) Starting in early 2016 with version 48, Chrome will display a certificate error if it encounters a site with a leaf certificate that is signed with a SHA-1-based signature, issued on or after January 1, 2016.
- [Google is about to start indexing HTTPS pages by default](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/indexing-https-pages-by-default.html): Google will start crawling HTTPS equivalents of HTTP pages, even when the former are not linked to from any page. When two URLs from the same domain appear to have the same content but are served over different protocol schemes, it will choose to index the HTTPS URL.
