Google recently announced a security policy change that will impact future versions of the Chrome browser. Chrome is already warning that support to [powerful features](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/) on insecure origins (HTTP) is deprecated, and according to recent announcements **the removal will take place soon**.

The initial features that will be removed on insecure origins will be:

- Geolocation (`getCurrentPosition()` and `watchPosition()`)
- Fullscreen
- Device motion / orientation
- Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)
- `getUserMedia()`

If your web site or app is currently using any powerful feature above, please immediately consider switching all your traffic to HTTPS only.
