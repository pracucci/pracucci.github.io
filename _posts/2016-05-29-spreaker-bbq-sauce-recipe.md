At the [recent company retreat](/spreaker-company-retreat-wrap-up.html), I brought my homemade BBQ sauce, named **Spreaker BBQ Sauce** for the occasion. Since I got pretty decent feedback, I decided to post here the full recipe, in case someone wanna etry to make it as well.

The recipe originated from a BBQ sauce I found in a cooking book, and then refined until I got a satisfying mix. It's pretty easy to prepare, except a couple of drawbacks: it takes some time to cook, and produces a bad smell during cooking (hey, just during cooking).

## Ingredients

| 250g    | Tomato puree |
| 100g    | Onion |
| 100g    | Mustard |
| 50g     | Vinegar |
| 50g     | Sugar (white) |
| 50g     | Butter |
| 25g     | Tomato concentrate |
| 1 spoon | Worcestershire sauce |
| -       | Hot pepper |
| -       | White and black pepper |
| -       | Butter |
| -       | Tabasco sauce |
| -       | Salt |

Remember to accurately choose high quality ingredients (expecially the tomato sauce). It's the basis to get a good result.


## Directions

1. Cut the onion in very small pieces.
2. In a pan, brown very slowly the butter and the onion.
3. Pour the vinegar in the pan, and keep it browning for 30 minutes (keep the fire low).
4. Add the tomato puree and concentrate, the mustard, sugar, hot pepper and pepper (the quantity depends on how much spicy you wanna get the sauce) and cook it for 3 hours. If the sauce gets too dry, add water.
5. Add the Worcestershire sauce (1 spoon) and Tabasco sauce (10/15 drops), and salt according your taste.
6. Voila! The sauce is ready!


## Pro Tip

I suggest to marinate pork ribs for at least 24h with the Spreaker BBQ sauce. Then cook it on the BBQ: the result is guaranteed!
