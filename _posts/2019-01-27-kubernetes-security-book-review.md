"**Kubernetes Security**" - written by [Liz Rice](https://twitter.com/lizrice) and [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) - is an excellent handbook that will introduce and guide you throw the best practices on securing your Kubernetes cluster.

The book has everything I would expect from an handbook: straight to the point, quick to read, full of references to go deeper learning the aspects you're most interested into and pragmatic. It covers Kubernetes security from different angles:

- The host, the cluster and the containers
- Authentication and authorization
- Secrets management

"Kubernetes Security" is one of that books that take a couple of hours to read, and at least a couple of months to put into practice.

The [**eBook is freely downloadable**](https://info.aquasec.com/kubernetes-security) and it should be a standard read for everyone working with Kubernetes - at different layers of the stack. Highly suggested!
