This is the video of a presentation I gave at the end of the last year at the [CNCF Italy](https://www.meetup.com/CNCF-Italy/) meetup ([slides here](/migrating-to-prometheus-what-we-learned-running-it-in-production.html)). It covers the basics of monitoring and how we approached Prometheus at [Spreaker](https://www.spreaker.com) and [Voxnest](https://www.voxnest.com). Enjoy!
