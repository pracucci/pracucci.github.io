Last weekend I was at talking to a neighbour at the park, an area with no internet connection. We're both software engineers and, as usually, the discussion turned to technology. He was asking me which tool to we use to **work remotely at Spreaker**. I was super happy about such question, and I immediately shout: Slack!

I took my phone from the pocket to show him, launched the app and... BOOM! **Slack doesn't work offline**!

### Why Slack should work Offline

Slack is a great product. We're using it since long time and it works like a charm. Despite it's an evoluted chat and you can obviously talk in real-time with other people, it gives the best to asynchronous communications too.

We use Slack to discuss features, share resources, take decisions. It's not just a chat, it's a virtual place where things happen. We have private groups for each single application and in such groups we discuss and write down the specifications about upcoming features.

**We also travel a lot**, sometimes **with limited internet connection** and there's where things go bad.

When you're offline and launch Slack, it doesn't run. If the application was already running, you can still read already displayed messages, but **you can't load or search messages, and send new ones**.

**DISCLAIMER**: don't take the following too much seriously.


### &lt;offline&gt;

What if Slack will **store all data locally, on your device**? It could sound crazy and it probably doesn't apply to large teams, but dumping all data locally could open to new possibilities:

- **Offline**: most features will work offline. Messages history, search, even sending new messages, that could be enqueued for delivery as soon as you come back online.
- **Search**: search will work offline and will be blazing fast.


### &lt;/offline&gt;
